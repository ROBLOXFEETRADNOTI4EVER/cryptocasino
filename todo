### **Total Estimated Time: ~230–280 hours (6–10 months)**

With your daily commitment of 20 minutes to 2 hours of coding per day and 3 hours on weekends, here’s a breakdown:

- **Weekdays (20–120 minutes/day)**: If you average about 1 hour per weekday, that’s about 5 hours per week.
- **Weekends (3 hours/day)**: On weekends, with 3 hours per day, you’ll get about 6 hours each weekend.

**Weekly Time Estimate**: ~11 hours/week.

### Conclusion:
Based on your current schedule of 30 minutes to 1-2 hours per day, with a boost on weekends, you should be able to complete this project in approximately **6 to 10 months**, depending on your consistency and how quickly you pick up new concepts.
